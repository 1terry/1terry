### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

**1terry/1terry** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working with the CRA on Java development and Wiki development using Confluence
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about AI, Fullstack programming, Programming in C++
- âš¡ Fun fact: I'm doing a minor in game design and hope to release a game in the future!
